# Hypersonic Visualization ðŸš€

Welcome to the Hypersonic Visualization repository! This project provides Python code for simulating and visualizing the trajectory and associated aerodynamic phenomena of a hypersonic vehicle. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or enthusiast, this tool will help you explore and understand the complexities of hypersonic flight.

## Description

Hypersonic flight is characterized by velocities exceeding five times the speed of sound (Mach 5+). This extreme regime introduces unique challenges related to aerodynamics, heat transfer, and material behavior. Understanding these phenomena is essential for designing efficient and reliable hypersonic vehicles for applications such as space exploration, military defense, and high-speed transportation.

The Hypersonic Visualization project aims to facilitate the analysis of hypersonic flight by providing a comprehensive visualization tool. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and finite element analysis (FEA), this tool enables users to explore various aspects of hypersonic flight, including trajectory dynamics, aerodynamic forces, shockwave behavior, thermal effects, and material deformation.

## Features

### 1. Trajectory Visualization

- **3D Visualization**: Render the trajectory of a hypersonic vehicle in a three-dimensional environment.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Visualize the vehicle's position, altitude, and velocity as it travels through the atmosphere.

### 2. Aerodynamic Phenomena

- **Aerodynamic Forces**: Display lift and drag forces acting on the vehicle over time.
- **Shockwave Visualization**: Render shockwaves generated by the vehicle's supersonic motion.
- **Boundary Layer Transition**: Simulate and visualize the transition from laminar to turbulent flow near the vehicle's surface.

### 3. Thermal Effects and Material Deformation

- **Thermal Dynamics**: Visualize temperature distributions and heat transfer effects during flight.
- **Material Response**: Display material deformation and structural changes under hypersonic conditions.

### 4. Interactive Exploration

- **Customization**: Adjust flight parameters such as velocity, altitude, and angle of attack for interactive exploration.
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Integrate live data streams for visualizing simulated hypersonic flights in real-time.

## Installation

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/hypersonic-visualization.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd hypersonic-visualization
   ```

3. **Install the required Python packages** using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the visualization script to generate plots of the hypersonic vehicle's trajectory and associated aerodynamic phenomena.

```bash
python visualize_hypersonic.py
```

This will generate plots displaying various aspects of the hypersonic flight, including trajectory, aerodynamic forces, shockwave intensity, boundary layer transition, thermal effects, material deformation, pressure distribution, and Mach number.
